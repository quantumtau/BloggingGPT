Let's discover the beauty of Thanksgiving, the Mexican way!



<h2>History of Thanksgiving in Mexico</h2>

While many might assume that Thanksgiving is a festivity celebrated exclusively in the United States and Canada, it might come as a surprise that our neighbors south of the border, Mexicans, also partake in this special holiday. **The history of Thanksgiving in Mexico** is an amalgamation of influences, historical events, and cultural adaptations that have shaped the holiday into a unique tradition cherished and celebrated by many. 

To understand how Thanksgiving became part of the Mexican calendar, we need to turn our attention back to the mid 19th century. During this time, American migrants who were fleeing the American civil war found refuge in Mexico. They relocated to Northern Mexico and brought with them their traditions, one of them being the celebration of Thanksgiving. This historical tie explains why the holiday initially took root more predominantly in the Mexican states close to the US border, such as Chihuahua and Sonora.

However, this is not the only pathway that Thanksgiving has trickled into Mexican tradition. Another pivotal moment came from relations between influential Mexican and American Presidents. The history books tell us that President Álvaro Obregón and President Dwight D. Eisenhower wanted to solidify the bonds between their nations, and a Thanksgiving dinner in August 1946 became a symbol of this intention. Every year since, the U.S. ambassador to Mexico holds a Thanksgiving dinner.

The celebration of Thanksgiving in Mexico is, as with many other traditions, a product of the nation's long standing role as a cultural crossroads. It has allowed for the birth of a tradition where **Mexican warmth, hospitality, and love for vibrant, hearty food, naturally resonated with the Thanksgiving symbolism of sharing and gratitude**.

The holiday's essence remains the same: giving thanks. Yet, don't expect to find your traditional turkey, cranberry sauce, and pecan pie on every Mexican Thanksgiving table. Many Mexican families opt to intertwine the feast with their own rich culinary traditions, replacing the turkey with tamales, bacalao, or pozole, creating a unique blend that is nothing short of a feast for the senses, showcasing the versatility and richness of Mexican cuisine.

<h3>Origins of the Celebration</h3>

Indeed, Mexico's celebration of Thanksgiving, or Día de Acción de Gracias, offers a rich tapestry of cultural traditions. To understand how Mexicans celebrate this holiday, one must first delve into its origins.

The celebration of Thanksgiving in Mexico is remarkably recent and arguably transcends culture and nationality, tracing back to the late 19th century. Surprisingly, the roots of Mexico's Thanksgiving are firmly planted in the American tradition. Immigrants from the United States brought the holiday to Mexico, sharing the familiar rituals of family gatherings, feasts, and gratitude.

The phenomenon began with the growing number of American settlers moving in the Mexican territory of Texas. They carried their customs, including Thanksgiving, into their new home. For many years, it was primarily celebrated by American immigrants and expatriates. Its spread was further facilitated when Mexico and the United States established closer ties in the 20th century, and Thanksgiving's popularity began to grow among locals.

It's critical to note that Thanksgiving is not a public holiday in Mexico, and its celebration is significantly influenced by American culture. This owes to a vast number of Mexicans studying and working in America and American tourism in Mexico. This confluence of cultures has led to a growing embracement of Thanksgiving traditions among the locals. Nonetheless, Thanksgiving in Mexico has been adapted uniquely and is often merged with Mexican traditions, displaying a fascinating blend of cultures. 

To quote cultural anthropologist Margarita R. de Orellana, "It is not unusual for cultures to absorb traditions from one another. Thanksgiving in Mexico is a great example of this. It has gradually become part of the annual calendar", symbolizing the bond and shared history between Mexico and the United States.

The heritage fuels the celebration of Thanksgiving in Mexico today, creating a distinctive fusion of Mexican and American customs that gives the holiday a distinctly Mexican flavor. Whether it's the addition of Mexican staples like chiles, nopalitos, and mole sauce to a traditional turkey feast, or the unity of family members in festivities, or the expression of gratitude - each aspect contributes to the uniqueness of Mexican Thanksgiving.

<h3>Influence of American Culture</h3>

When we think of Thanksgiving, we often envision the typical scene - a family sitting around a large table filled with roast turkey, mashed potatoes, cranberries, and pumpkin pies. However, the celebration of Thanksgiving is not just confined to the borders of America. There's an interesting question we'll explore – how has the American culture influenced the celebration of Thanksgiving in Mexico?

Rich in traditions, Mexican culture has deeply embraced American customs in unique ways. The influence of American culture has a significant role in fueling the introduction of Thanksgiving in Mexico. In some forms, this influence is evident in the manner the holiday is celebrated in the American expat communities residing in Mexico.

Despite Thanksgiving not being a native holiday in Mexico, it has gradually been adopted by these communities. However, let's be clear: Mexicans aren’t declaring "Thanksgiving Day" as a national holiday just yet, but the American culture has indeed encouraged a Mexican version of it.

The centerpiece - the turkey, or "pavo" in Spanish, is usually present, but the Mexican touches can be seen in the rich, spicy sauces adorning the bird, often feeling a nod to the mole. The cuisine also typically includes some Mexican staples, such as chiles in nogada, tamales, and flan. Yet, the turkey, cranberry sauce, and pumpkin pies remain as central elements of the feast, clearly showing the influence of American tradition.

Some American traditions have also pervaded the atmosphere around the holiday. Although Thanksgiving Day is generally a normal working day in Mexico, TV broadcasts popular American events like the NFL's Dallas Cowboys and Detroit Lions annual football games, and the iconic Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade. 

Rather than an assimilation of cultures, these practices demonstrate a harmonious blend of both Mexican and American traditions. This has resulted in a unique mix, a testament to societal adaptation that holds the essence of both original customs.

Mexicans typically value spiritual reflection and family gathering above all. So even if the actual event originates from a completely foreign background, it seamlessly blends into their culture, since it resonates with the values that Mexicans deeply hold. In any case, the influence of American culture on these celebrations encompasses more than merely importing traditions. It symbolizes a merging of values, histories, and ultimately, communities. 

While Thanksgiving is universally seen as a time for being thankful for life's blessings, the Mexican style of observing the occasion reflects the country's cultural richness and diversity. It exemplifies how global cultures can influence and adapt to a local setting, setting a perfect example of intercultural exchange and harmonious blending of customs. 

Celebrating Thanksgiving the Mexican way shows us that regardless of the place, embracing thankfulness and enjoying a meal with loved ones remains the core essence of this beloved holiday season.

<h2>Traditional Mexican Thanksgiving Dishes</h2>

When you think of Thanksgiving, the traditional image conjured is likely one of turkey, cranberry sauce, and pumpkin pie set on an American family table. However, let's take a fascinating journey south of the border to explore how Thanksgiving is celebrated in Mexican households. Thanksgiving is as widely celebrated in Mexico as it is in the United States, with Mexican families gathering to express gratitude together. 

The most thrilling part of these celebrations is arguably the food, where the fusion of Mexican and American culinary traditions takes center stage. These dishes warm hearts and unite families and they reflect the amalgamation of two rich cultures served on a plate. 

Take the turkey, for instance. In Mexico, turkey is a common main dish for Thanksgiving, just as it is in America. However, its preparation is undeniably influenced by traditional Mexican cuisine. While the bird may be roasted in the usual American way, it won't be unusual if it is slathered in a mole sauce made of chocolate, chili peppers, and a hint of cinnamon - a beloved Mexican staple. This gives the turkey a distinctly rich, sweet, and spicy taste – a true treat for the senses!

Side dishes also come with a twist. An all-time favorite is chiles en nogada, a dish that encapsulates the colors of the Mexican flag. This dish consists of poblano chiles stuffed with spiced meat, fruits, and nuts, blanketed in a creamy walnut sauce, and garnished with bright red pomegranate seeds. It's a traditional recipe usually served during Mexican patriotic celebrations but added to the Thanksgiving table for a flavorful experience. 

And let's not forget dessert! Pumpkin pie may still be present, but it might be sharing space with Mexican desserts such as flan, a creamy caramel custard; and 'pan de muerto', a deliciously sweet bread often served for Day of the Dead celebrations. 

It's clear that Thanksgiving in a Mexican household is a marvelous blend of American and Mexican traditions. It celebrates not just the spirit of gratitude, but also a love for food that bonds these two cultures together. The act of giving thanks knows no borders, but when we look to Mexico, we see a Thanksgiving celebration with its unique, flavorful twist.

<h3>Mexican Turkey Recipes</h3>

As we embark on this flavorsome journey exploring Mexican turkey recipes for Thanksgiving, it's essential to understand the importance of food in Mexican celebrations. **Food, especially turkey, plays a quintessential role in Mexican Thanksgiving**, bringing families together around the table and serving as a medium to express gratitude and love. 

One of the most beloved dishes is the mouth-watering **'Pavo Relleno'** or stuffed turkey. Traditionally, the turkey is marinated a day in advance with a tantalizing mix of Mexican spices such as cumin, chili powder, and oregano. The stuffing often consists of a hearty combination of ground meat, fruits, and nuts that complement the complex flavors of the bird. Once baked to perfection, the stuffed turkey is often served with a tangy **'Mole sauce'**, an iconic Mexican sauce made with over 20 ingredients, including chili peppers, spices, bread, and chocolate. 

In addition to Pavo Relleno, Mexican Thanksgiving also witnesses the delightful **‘Pavo Enchilado’**, translating to Chili Turkey. This recipe sees the turkey marinated in a chili sauce, often a blend of guajillo and ancho peppers. The turkey is roasted till it becomes succulent and absorbs all the spicy goodness of the chili.

Of course, how can we leave out the famous **'Tamales'**? While not traditionally a turkey dish, some families create a unique fusion by adding leftover turkey to the masa (dough) before it's wrapped in corn husks and steamed. The end product is a sumptuous tamale, bursting with the flavors of savory turkey. 

And there you have it—a peek into the Mexican kitchen during Thanksgiving where the gratifying aroma of turkey mingles with the hand-ground spices and fills the air with a memorable scent. Be it Pavo Relleno, Pavo Enchilado, or turkey tamales, these Mexican Thanksgiving turkey dishes highlight the beautiful amalgamation of profound flavors, love, and gratitude.

When it comes to the Thanksgiving celebration in Mexico, a phenomenal portion of the festivity is the **array of unique side dishes** that grace the dining table. Considering that Mexican cuisine is globally renowned for its vibrant flavors and elaborate preparation, the Thanksgiving spread in a Mexican household does not disappoint.

Let's not leave out **Camotes Enmielados**, or Candied Sweet Potatoes.

One such delightful culinary tradition that stands out is **Chiles en Nogada**.

Over time, Chiles en Nogada embodied jubilation and unanimity; from Independence Day feasts in September to today's Thanksgiving feasts, it has been a timeless gustatory symbol of celebration. 

Every ingredient utilized for Chiles en Nogada carries a story rooted in the historical Mexican soil. The main component, poblano chiles are not just any other chiles.

The stuffing, a lush mix of meat, dried fruits, and spices, vividly portrays a spicy-sweet balance reminiscent of the ancient Aztec cuisine. It is usually a mix of shredded pork, almonds, raisins, apple, pear, and a smidge of cinnamon, encapsulated inside the chiles, providing an explosion of flavors with every bite. 

Then comes the crowning glory, the Nogada, a creamy white walnut sauce. This sauce traditionally maintains a hint of sherry and a gentle sweetness, coming from freshly harvested walnuts. It encapsulates the chiles, further enriching the flavors.

<h4>Tamales</h4>

When one thinks about Thanksgiving, a roasted turkey is usually the first dish that comes to mind. However, when it comes to **Mexican Thanksgiving celebrations**, a beloved and much-anticipated dish takes center stage: **Tamales**.

Tamales are an essential part of Mexican culinary tradition across the country. Wrapped in corn husks or banana leaves and bursting with flavors, they showcase the local harvest in a beautiful way. It's not simply a dish; it's more of a cultural phenomenon that emanates the essence of the rich and vibrant Mexican heritage.

In the context of Thanksgiving, it might come off as surprising to some, but Tamales hold a special place at the dinner table in many Mexican households. They join the turkey as a **delicious side dish**, bringing an irresistible mixture of tastes to the festive meal.

Firstly, let's understand what a tamale is: This **Mexican delicacy** consists of a dough—known as 'masa', made from hominy (corn that has been treated with alkali)—filled with a variety of options like meats, cheeses, vegetables or fruits, then wrapped in a corn husk or banana leaf. The tamale is then steamed until it reaches the ideal consistency. What you get is a mouthwatering dish that's simultaneously hearty and delicate.

Now, we return to the question: Why do Mexicans incorporate Tamales into their Thanksgiving dinner? The answer is deep-rooted in culture and tradition. Honoring their ancestors and maintaining traditions, Mexicans often include Tamales in their festivities, especially during the holiday season. Thanksgiving is an ideal occasion for preserving those customs and sharing them with the broader community.

Another key aspect to note is the communal effort that goes into making Tamales. Often, families will gather for what's known as "tamalada," akin to a tamale-making party. This event not only helps in preparing the large number of Tamales required for the feast, but **celebrates togetherness**, sharing, and cooperation - values that align perfectly with the spirit of Thanksgiving.

Tamales in a Mexican Thanksgiving dinner signify far more than just another item on the menu. They are a **symbol of heritage, unity, and gratitude**. So, next time you're invited to a Mexican Thanksgiving dinner, you'll know the historical and cultural significance behind that delicious tamale you're enjoying!

<h2>Celebration Customs</h2>

When one thinks of Thanksgiving, the instant image that pops up is of Americans seated around a dining table loaded with roast turkey, cranberry sauce, pumpkin pie, and other delightful delicacies. But Thanksgiving extends beyond the borders of America. Many will be glad to know that this gracious and celebratory spirit is equally cherished in Mexico with a Mexican touch of flair and flavor. 

Thanksgiving in Mexico is a grandiosity, an amalgamation of time-honored traditions, revelrous customs, and mouth-watering cuisine, celebrated with an intensity that complements the vibrant Mexican culture. **Mexican Thanksgiving celebration customs** have a unique spin, deviating somewhat from the traditional North American ones while still preserving the core essence of being thankful. 

Focusing on togetherness, Mexicans typically begin the celebration by **gathering together family and friends**. Whether it's in the heart of Mexico City or a rural pueblo, a Mexican thanksgiving takes precedence over communal harmony and the union of loved ones. 

In true Mexican style, the centerpiece of the celebration is a **lavish food spread**. But it's not just turkey, stuffing, and sweet potatoes. Mexicans put their own twist on the meal. You would find a classic **turkey marinated in spice-rich adobo** or served with tangy, rich Mole sauce. Other typical dishes include Tamales, Enchiladas, and sweet Cornbread. Some households even opt for 'Bacalao a la Vizcaina', a traditional dish made with salted cod, tomatoes, olives, and capers, rather than turkey. 

Imparting an other-worldly charm to the Mexican Thanksgiving is their passionately followed tradition of **creating beautiful 'ofrendas' or offering altars**. Vibrantly colored, these altars are embellished with photographs, candles, marigold flowers, and favorite foods of departed loved ones, symbolizing a reunion with them.

In many regions of Mexico, especially in places with a large American expatriate population, Thanksgiving includes a ritual called "la cadena de gratitud" or **the gratitude chain**. Participants write what they're thankful for on a piece of paper and add it to a chain, symbolizing the connection and gratefulness in their community. 

Mexican Thanksgiving is, essentially, a **fiesta of gratitude, unity, and remembrance** with a heavy dose of delicious food. So even as Mexicans relish in a traditional American holiday, their distinct customs and traditions give life to a Thanksgiving celebration that is authentically and beautifully, very Mexican.

<h3>Family Gatherings</h3>

While Thanksgiving may not be a traditional Mexican holiday, more and more families in Mexico are embracing the festivity, particularly those with American connections. One integral element, that also mirrors the American celebration of Thanksgiving, is the significance of **family gatherings** during this period.

It’s critical to comprehend that, similar to Thanksgiving in the United States, the Mexican version of the holiday is also a perfect time to bring families together - an element deeply rooted in the Mexican culture. Family is considered the backbone of the society and the occasion further amplifies this sentiment. Preparations for this occasion start weeks in advance with family members from different places converging on a common household to **celebrate together**.

It’s a time for family members - across multiple generations - to unite around the dining table, enjoying a feast while sharing stories and experiences, expressing their gratitude for each other and the blessings of the past year. These gatherings are not just about the mere act of eating together; but, more importantly, they serve as a symbol of unity, love, and a celebration of shared heritage – essentially reflecting Mexico's entrenched family-oriented culture.

Intriguingly, while the main feature of the meal - turkey - corresponds with the American tradition, the Thanksgiving spread in Mexican households is often garnished with delicious Mexican flavors and twists. Recipes passed down through generations find their way into the menu giving it the unique Mexican essences whilst maintaining the Thanksgiving theme.

A key characteristic that makes the gatherings even more special is the involvement of everyone in the preparation for this celebration—it’s a customary practice that everyone contributes their bit. "The **inclusiveness of family members** in the preparations", as some Mexican families describe, "adds an element of shared joy and anticipation for the celebration", thus enhancing family ties.

<h3>Is Thanksgiving celebrated widely in Mexico?</h3>

Mexico is rich in its vibrant culture and age-old traditions. Landing on the topic of Thanksgiving, one might scratch heads, wondering, **"Is Thanksgiving really celebrated widely in Mexico?"**. Well, this answer is both intriguing and detailed. Let's dive deeper.

It's essential to understand that **Thanksgiving is primarily an North American holiday**, deeply rooted in the history of the United States. It's more of a cultural phenomenon than a globally recognized event. However, the world we live in today is a global village. Constants are fluid, and cultural elements traverse borders with impressive flexibility. And so it is with Thanksgiving! 

From Baja California in the north to Yucatan in the south, some Mexican households do celebrate Thanksgiving, but in a manner quite Mexican! A look at the geographical distribution of Thanksgiving festivities in Mexico depicts a spread influenced heavily by proximity to the United States. 

**Northern Mexican states like Baja California, Chihuahua, and Tamaulipas**, with close geographical proximity to the U.S., tend to have a larger number of people celebrating Thanksgiving. Many families in these regions, often with ties to the U.S., have adapted this tradition, albeit with a unique twist, incorporating Mexican dishes alongside the traditional turkey. 

However, moving further south into the heartland of Mexico, Thanksgiving isn't as widely recognized or celebrated. Here, traditional Mexican holidays like **Dia de los Muertos** or the **Day of the Dead** are more predominant and closer to the hearts of the locals.

<h3>How similar or dissimilar is Mexican Thanksgiving to American Thanksgiving?</h3>

While the concept of Thanksgiving stems from an entirely American historical event, the spirit of gratitude and conviviality is hardly limited to the US borders. **Mexicans, too, commemorate this occasion with their unique flair and traditions**, despite the celebration not being grounded in their historical traditions. This may raise a question in the minds of many: how similar or dissimilar is Mexican Thanksgiving to American Thanksgiving? 

In terms of similarities, Mexicans, much like their American counterparts, gather around with their family and loved ones to share a special meal. This ceremonial dinner often takes place on the fourth Thursday of November, reflecting the American tradition. The essence of the occasion is to show gratitude, and in this respect, too, both celebrations coincide as both cultures appreciate the idea of being grateful for their respective blessings. The common principle here is "**family, food, and gratitude.**"

In contrast, a distinct feature that sets Mexican Thanksgiving apart is its unique confluence of American and Mexican traditions. There's a twist to the traditional Thanksgiving fare - the turkey might be served with a spicy mole sauce instead of the American-style gravy, for instance. Mexican dishes such as tamales, enchiladas, and chiles en nogada often make an appearance on the festive table alongside the classic turkey, adding an unmistakably Mexican flavor to the occasion. 

While American Thanksgiving is heavily associated with football, watching TV, and Black Friday sales, these quintessentially American activities are not a part of the Mexican celebration. Instead, Mexicans focus more on family gatherings, spending quality time with their loved ones, and of course, indulging in their variants of traditional Thanksgiving dishes.

Indeed, Mexican Thanksgiving might not have a historical context like in America, where it commemorates the Pilgrims' first successful harvest in the New World. However, it is adopted with a unanimous spirit among Mexicans, and "**is seen as a way to embrace the shared cultural ties with their American neighbors.**"

Fun fact: did you know the term for Thanksgiving in Spanish is "**Día de Acción de Gracias**"?
